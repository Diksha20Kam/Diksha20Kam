**Problem Statement**

As the world increasingly relies on conversational AI for customer support, education, and other use cases, traditional chatbots often fail to deliver engaging and contextually accurate responses. Limitations include:

Static Interaction: Traditional bots lack dynamic and real-time capabilities for long-form or context-sensitive queries.
Complex Setup: Most AI models require heavy server-side configurations and lack streamlined interfaces for end-users.
User Experience: Many tools fail to retain conversation context, reducing engagement.
To address these gaps, this project leverages Googleâ€™s Gemini Pro LLM to build an interactive chatbot with features such as context retention, real-time streaming responses, and an easy-to-use interface.



**Conclusion**
This project demonstrates how to combine cutting-edge LLM technology with intuitive interfaces to create an engaging and functional chatbot. It is a robust, secure, and scalable solution suitable for a wide range of applications. By leveraging tools like Streamlit and Gemini Pro, the project exemplifies how AI can be used to solve real-world problems effectively.
